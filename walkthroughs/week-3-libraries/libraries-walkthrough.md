# Libraries

## Getting Started

Over the past 2 weeks, you've learned about client-side HTML and JavaScript, and
server-side Java.

This week, you're going to learn about libraries that provide access to various
features of Google Cloud.

You can return to this walkthrough anytime by running this command:

```bash
teachme ~/software-product-sprint/walkthroughs/week-3-libraries/libraries-walkthrough.md
```
