          One of my main missions I always strove for during my time at University is helping women
          in Computer Science feel empowered and that they have a sense of community within the male-dominated
          field. There have been instances where I was the only female in my class periods, making me feel
          a bit of an outsider. By taking the recuitment chair position for University of Minnesota's ACM-W chapter, I felt I was
          able connect and strengthen the female community in my school's CS student body. Learning to program
          is extremely rewarding but also very difficult, so by providing career / academic oppurtunities and a sense of
          belonging to these women does wonders in keeping them in this field.

          In terms of my own career, I started TA'ing in a coding camp for
           high & middle school aged girls. The camp taught basic html / css / javascript to these girls
           and was intended to inspire them to pursue Computer Science by providing positive exposure to coding early on.
           After that, in Summer 2018 I was fortunate enough to spend a summer assisting in designing
           <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3287324.3293858" target="_blank">a study</a> for 
           <a href="https://people.engr.ncsu.edu/tbdimitr/" target="_blank">Dr. Lina Battestilli</a>
            at North Carolina State University; the study looked to improve CS education for non-CS majoring engineers. Specifically,
           we looked at the questions of autonomous grading systems to see if we could improve the way coding
           excercises were asked.

          The last major experience I had was finally in industry; Summer 2019 I flew out to Manhattan
          to work as a software engineer intern at American Express. There, I learned a lot about front-end
          development, as my team worked on a webapp using JavaScript's React-Redux and Bootstrap libraries.
          It was the first real exposure I had with github, JavaScript, and front-end development in general. 
          It was a hard learning curve but came with it was a strong sense of fulfillment! Now, I get the 
          treat to train and learn with Google throught their Software Product Sprint and will soon be spending
          another two months virtually interning for American Express again.

          On a less dry note, I am an Animal Crossing fanatic with an affinity for the outdoors. There seems to
          always be an excuse to enjoy the greenery outside! Ghibli movies are also a highlight in my life;
          nothing says cozy at home like watching My Neighbor Totoro! Lastly, I really start vibing when listening
          to Logic or MGK. Love the buzz that a fast-paced rap can bring!
